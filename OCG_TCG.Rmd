## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r price_dist}

TCG_Prices$DateTime <- as.Date(TCG_Prices$DateTime)
OCG_Prices$DateTime <- as.Date(OCG_Prices$DateTime)

# Set the exchange rate, e.g., 1 JPY = 0.0073 USD
exchange_rate <- 0.0063

# Convert OCG prices to USD
OCG_Prices$price_usd <- OCG_Prices$price * exchange_rate

# Basic statistics
summary(TCG_Prices)
summary(OCG_Prices)

# Price distribution comparison
ggplot(TCG_Prices, aes(x = tcgplayer_price)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  ggtitle("TCG Player Price Distribution")

ggplot(OCG_Prices, aes(x = price_usd)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  ggtitle("OCG Price Distribution")

```

```{r set_price_dist}
ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(data = TCG_Prices, aes(x = rarity, y = tcgplayer_price, fill = "TCG"), outlier.size = 1) +
  geom_boxplot(data = OCG_Prices, aes(x = rarity, y = price_usd, fill = "OCG"), outlier.size = 1) +
  scale_y_log10() +  # Log transformation to deal with skewness
  labs(title = "Comparison of Prices by Rarity", x = "Rarity", y = "Price (log scale)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TCG" = "blue", "OCG" = "red"))
```
